**1. PayTV systems require that only the paid customers can watch the program, which of the 5 security services can be used to achieve this goal?**

**Solution:**
**2. Determine the complexity (number of arithmetic operations) of:**	
1. **computing $gcd(a,b)$;**

	**Solution:**


2. **computing RSA encryption $C=M^e$ mod $n$**

	**Solution:**


**3. Limitation of raw RSA signature: Only when M has redundancy structure, can the signature be securely verified. Why?**

**Solution:**
**4. For RSA, it requires $|p-q|$ should not be small. Task: design an attack if $|p-q|$ is smaller than 10000.**

**Solution:**
**5. Show that in RSA, knowing $Ñ„(n)$ is equivalent to knowing the factorization of $n$.**

**Solution:**
